I am currently working on making some tweaks and changes to acheive the following goals:

- Adaptations to suit the centre frequency, sweep bandwidth and modulation rate of my radar electronics

- Avoid the use of expensive commercial software like MATLAB, and adapt the code for signal processing of the audio samples such that
the same results can be had without proprietary software.
